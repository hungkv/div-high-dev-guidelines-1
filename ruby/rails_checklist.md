## Rails checklist
### Readable and following standards
- [ ] Commit message contains ticket ID
- [ ] Namming: variable/methods/class
### Minimal and working solution
- [ ] Efficient
  - [ ] Checked N+1 queries
  - [ ] Checked missing index
- [ ] To prove it's working the unit tests, integration tests should be updated
  - [ ] Code coverage is 80% or above
### Logging
- [ ] Errors are sent to log
### Sercurity
- [ ] Authentication
  - [ ] Enforce a minimum password length of 8 characters or more
  - [ ] Lock the account after multiple failed login attempts
  - [ ] Ensure all non-public controllers/actions require authentication
- [ ] Sessions & Cookies
  - [ ] Unless your JavaScript frontend needs to read cookies generated by the Rails server, set all cookies as httponly
  - [ ] Don't user privileges or money to Cookie
  - [ ] Always using encrypted cookies
- [ ] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - [ ] Enclose attribute values with double quotes
  - [ ] Validate user input that may eventually be displayed to other users
- [ ] File
  - [ ] Do not trust validations implemented at the client. Always (re)validate at the server.
  - [ ] Validate files before processing
  - [ ] Limit file size
- [ ] Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - [ ] Enforce CSRF protection by setting protect_from_forgery with: :exception in all controllers
- [ ] TLS/SSL
  - [ ] Force TLS/SSL on all URLs, including links, assets, images for internal and 3rd party URLs. No mixed protocols.
- [ ] Sensitive Data
  - [ ] Don't log sensitive data such as passwords and credit card numbers
### Others
- [ ] No hardcoding credentials
- [ ] No duplicate code present
- [ ] Code has been aggressively DRYed during development
- [ ] All tests pass before code is merged into a shared repository
- [ ] Have tests for email functions
- [ ] Do not use AWS and other 3rd services credentials for unit tests

- [ ] Set default values for database columns if needed
- [ ] Use Settings or constant for static value
- [ ] Use FactoryGirl for mocking data
- [ ] Unless JavaScript frontend needs to read cookies generated by the Rails server, set all cookies as httponly [Securing Rails Applications - Sessions](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#sessions)
- [ ] Encoding: utf-8 everywhere
- [ ] Migration won't break (not null without default, too big table to update, rollback step work correctly)
